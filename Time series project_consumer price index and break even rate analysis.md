In this project we will analyze consumer price index (CPI) and break even rate (BER) data for the last decade.

The CPI is the price of a "market basket of consumer goods and services" - a proxy for inflation while BER is the difference in yield between a fixed rate and inflation adjusted 10 year treasury note. This difference can be interpreted as what the market views will be the inflation rate for the next 10 years, on average.

The data will be read from two files `CPI.csv` for CPI and `T10YIE.csv` for BER in the `data_and_materials` folder.
